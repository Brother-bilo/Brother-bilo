- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Christopher Ferguson, a rising Senior Economics Student at JMU. 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Economics, Data Analysis, The uses of Sentiment Analysis in Markets, Public Policy, and Economic thought.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python(ML, Sentiment Analysis), R(Econometrics), and brushing up on Math so I can hopefully get my PhD in Econ or some data driven field.
